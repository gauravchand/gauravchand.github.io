                Copy the name shown in Japanese and put it in the search bar along with the

                This will show an Instagram reel which when you play shows the same building as
                shown in the given image.<br>
                The description of the reel gives names of two stations namely “<b>JR Ueno station</b>”
                and “<b>Uguisudani station</b>”.<br>
                Also note that the building next to the billboard has cross sign (likely to be a
                church).<br>
                Considering these and looking between the stations gets us to the desired spot.

                Reverse image search gives name of the ship “Shinyo Maru”.<br>
                Visiting the “maritime database” site gives us details about the ship.<br><br>

                A little bit of research on the part “number that would remain same if the ship 
                were to be sold to foreign country in the future” points at the IMO number which
                is 9767675.<br><br>

                The name of the ship is to be submitted in local language (Japanese), so visiting a 
                native website would yield better outcome.<br>
                Searching the owner of ship (in order to find their website) gives us “Tokyo
                University of Marine Science and Technology”.<br>
                When you search “shinyo maru Tokyo university”, it leads us to native website
                “<a href="kaiyodai.ac.jp" target="_blank">kaiyodai.ac.jp</a>” which contains ship details in English.<br>
                Changing web page language to Japanese to get the accurate name of the ship
                gives us “神鷹丸”.

                So, in the video, we see car turning at a node (picking up pace) and the 
                bus trying to overtake the bus ahead of it (almost crashing into the car).<br>
                The important thing to be noted here is the name on the bus “SBS transit”, a little
                bit of searching implies that the video is based on Singapore.<br><br>

                There were two buses in the video and one of the bus' number was 52, so I searched for the
                route in google maps.<br>
                After that, try to find residential area in the route which (after some searching) was
                almost around the end of the bus route (115, Bishan Street 12, Singapore).

                Visiting any site gives the location “St. Petersburg, Russia” (which is quite vague).<br>
                Scroll a bit and you find a different angle of the same billboard (might help in visualizing the location from maps)<br><br>

                Note that there is a text in russian in the image. Copy that and put in the search

                This will give multiple outlets of the shop shown in the image.<br>
