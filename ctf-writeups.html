                Copy the name shown in Japanese and put it in the search bar along with the <br>
                image.<br>
                This will show an Instagram reel which when you play shows the same building as <br>
                shown in the given image.<br>
                The description of the reel gives names of two stations namely “JR Ueno station” <br>
                and “Uguisudani station”.<br>
                Also note that the building next to the billboard has cross sign (likely to be a <br>
                church).<br>
                Considering these and looking between the stations gets us to the desired spot.

                Reverse image search gives name of the ship “Shinyo Maru”.<br>
                Visiting the “maritime database” site gives us details about the ship.<br><br>

                A little bit of research on the part “number that would remain same if the ship <br>
                were to be sold to foreign country in the future” points at the IMO number which <br>
                is 9767675.<br><br>

                The name of the ship is to be submitted in local language (Japanese), so visiting a <br>
                native website would yield better outcome.<br>
                Searching the owner of ship (in order to find their website) gives us “Tokyo <br>
                University of Marine Science and Technology”.<br>
                When you search “shinyo maru Tokyo university”, it leads us to native website <br>
                “kaiyodai.ac.jp” which contains ship details in English.<br>
                Changing web page language to Japanese to get the accurate name of the ship <br>
                gives us “神鷹丸”.

                <p>In this video, where did the car and bus almost collide?</p>

                So, in the video, we see car turning at a node (picking up pace) and the <br>
                bus trying to overtake the bus ahead of it (almost crashing into the car).<br>
                The important thing to be noted here is the name on the bus “SBS transit”, a little <br>
                bit of searching implies that the video is based on Singapore.<br><br>

                There were two buses and one of the bus’ number was 52, so I searched for the <br>
                route in google maps.<br>
                After that, try to find residential area in the route which (after some searching) was <br>
                almost around the end of the bus route (115, Bishan Street 12, Singapore).

                This will give multiple outlets of the shop shown in the image.<br>
